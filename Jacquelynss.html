	<h3> Who am I?</h3>
    
    <p> Currently, I am a <strong>stressed</strong> junior at The New School studying Journalism &amp; Design with a minor in Fashion Communitions. I'm suprisingly making my way through finals with out dying (yet.)
      I am in my early twenties, trying to navigate my way through life and finding my place in the world. Right now I live in Mount Vernon, NY with my Jamaican grandmother, and that is another story for another time. I was born in White Plains, 
      NY but after the tragedy of 9/11 my family and I moved to Tampa, FL. I have two older brothers, Justin and Jonathan, 
      and a little yorkie named Julio. My favorite color is pink, (specifically millennial pink) 
      I love to sleep, eat, shop, and read (in that order.) </p>
